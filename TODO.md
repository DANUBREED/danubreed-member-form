# TODO: Add Confirmation Page for Successful Registration

- [x] Create app/confirm/page.tsx with confirmation UI
- [x] Update components/registration-form.tsx to navigate to '/confirm' after successful registration
- [x] Remove form reset in onSubmit since navigation will redirect the user
- [x] Test the registration flow to ensure redirection works (app is running on localhost:3000)
